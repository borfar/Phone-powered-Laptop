# Phone-powered Laptop
Project name: Project Q1

**Big Bang Competition 2024 — Bors Farago**

Project Q1 is an innovative low-cost computing solution that transforms a smartphone into a fully functional laptop. The project tackles e-waste, affordability, and performance limitations in entry-level computers by leveraging the power users already carry in their pockets.

## ❗ Problem

Entry-level laptops today suffer from several major issues:

* ♻️ Significant **e-waste** due to short device lifespans
* 💸 High **cost barrier** for basic computing
* 🔧 Limited **customisability**
* 🐢 Poor **performance** that frustrates users

Many people already own powerful smartphones, yet still need to purchase separate low-performance laptops.

---

## 💡 Solution — What is Project Q1?

**Project Q1 is a laptop powered by your phone.**

Instead of buying a full computer, users dock their smartphone into a lightweight laptop shell that provides:

* Display
* Keyboard
* Trackpad
* Ports
* Laptop form factor

The phone becomes the brain of the system.
