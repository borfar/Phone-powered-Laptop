**Project Q1** is a low-cost laptop shell powered entirely by your smartphone. Instead of buying a separate computer, you dock your phone into the device and use it like a normal laptop.

This project was awarded **Runner-Up for the Intermediate Technology Award** at the Big Bang Competition 2024.

## Why I built this
- cheap laptops are very slow
- growing e-waste
- modern smartphones are often more powerful than laptops

I wanted to answer a simple question:

> Can your phone replace your laptop for everyday tasks?

## What it does

* Turns your phone into a laptop
* Provides screen, keyboard, and trackpad, USB hub
* Keeps costs very low (<£100 target)
* Reuses hardware people already own

## Current status

I designed and 3D-printed a working prototype as a proof of concept:

* Custom hinge
* Phone dock
* Display mount

Overall, this prototype has been a large success. Everything functions as expected, and feedback has been generally positive.

## What’s next

I plan to develop this concept into a more polished device.
