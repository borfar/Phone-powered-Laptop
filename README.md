**Project Q1** is a low-cost laptop shell powered entirely by your smartphone. Instead of buying a separate low-end computer, you dock your phone into the device and use it like a normal laptop.

This project was awarded **Runner-Up for the Intermediate Technology Award** at the Big Bang Competition 2024.

## Why I built this

Many affordable laptops are slow, expensive for what they offer, and contribute to growing e-waste. At the same time, most people already carry a powerful smartphone.

Project Q1 explores a simple question:

> Can your phone replace your laptop for everyday tasks?

## What it does

* Turns your phone into a laptop
* Provides screen, keyboard, and trackpad
* Keeps costs very low (~£60 target)
* Reuses hardware people already own

## Current status

I designed and 3D-printed a working prototype, including:

* Custom hinge
* Phone dock
* Display mount

The prototype has been tested for basic tasks like email, browsing, and light apps.

## What’s next

I plan to develop this concept into a more polished device.
